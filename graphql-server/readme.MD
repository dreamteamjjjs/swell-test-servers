GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to the REST API.

Here are some key features of GraphQL:

Strongly Typed Schema: GraphQL is based on a strong type system which helps to ensure that an API only offers operations that are supported by the server. Each API is defined by its types and the relationships between those types.
Client-Specified Queries: In GraphQL, the client makes precise requests and receives exactly what it needs, nothing more and nothing less. This avoids the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching data, which is common with REST APIs.
Single Endpoint: Unlike REST APIs that require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
Real-Time Updates: GraphQL subscriptions support real-time updates by maintaining a steady connection to the server. This is particularly useful in applications that require real-time functionality like chat apps or live updates.
Introspective: GraphQL APIs are self-documenting. The API schema defines what queries are possible, what types of data can be fetched, and what the results will look like. This can help tooling and automation to build around the API.
Overall, GraphQL offers a highly efficient and flexible approach to managing data interactions between clients and servers, making it an increasingly popular choice for modern web and mobile applications.
