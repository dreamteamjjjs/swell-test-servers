RPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It allows developers to define methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types, and it automatically handles the underlying communication details. Here are some key features of gRPC:

Language Independent: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, making it easy to create applications that work together over a network despite being written in different languages.
HTTP/2 Based: It uses HTTP/2 for transport, which allows for features like multiplexing (multiple requests and responses over a single connection), server push, and efficient connection usage.
Protocol Buffers: By default, gRPC uses protocol buffers, Google's mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data. Protocol buffers are both smaller and faster than JSON and XML.
Streaming Support: gRPC supports streaming requests and responses, allowing for continuous data transfer, which is useful for real-time applications.
Interoperability and Scalability: It is designed for low latency and high scalability, which makes it suitable for connecting distributed services in microservices architecture.
Security: Built-in security using TLS/SSL, and also supports other authentication mechanisms.
This framework is particularly well-suited for building connected systems, offering both performance benefits and a structured approach to service interoperability.

Start Up:

1. node server.js
2. node client.js

// make sure to use localhost:number as the uri
